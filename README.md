## Gmail Password Reset Setup

For email-based password reset functionality, you'll need to configure Gmail as the email backend. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

### 1. **Email Configuration in Django**

In your **`settings.py`**, configure the email backend:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'  # Replace with your Gmail address
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'  # Replace with your Gmail password or app password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER



Replace 'your-email@gmail.com' with your Gmail address.
For Gmail, you might need to generate an App Password if you have 2-step verification enabled. You can do this in your Google Account Settings.
